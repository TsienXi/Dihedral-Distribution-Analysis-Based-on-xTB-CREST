# Dihedral-Distribution-Analysis-Based-on-xTB-CREST
This repository provides the xyz files and code used to generate and analyze the dihedral angle distributions of cinchona alkaloid catalysts.

QD-merged.xyz contains all the xyz structures for catalyst **QD** obtained from xTB-CREST simulation
Q-merged.xyz contains all the xyz structures for catalyst **Q** obtained from xTB-CREST simulation

Draw.ipynb has all the codes for generating all the figures of dihedral distributions.
